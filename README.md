# RushDoc

A SwiftUI application developed for ISTE-454

- RushDoc allows users to book digital/physical appointments with doctors, pharmacies, or clinics.
- The search takes into account the userâ€™s health insurance. It also allows users to have live audio/video calls with health personnel.

- It targets two groups of users:
  - users who need medical services but do not know whether or not their insurance will cover the expenses;
  - users who just want to briefly consult a doctor via text message or video call.

**NOTE**: The application is for the sole porpure of showcasing in class. It is not production ready and does not follow privacy/security laws in the United States
